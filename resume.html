									<p>It takes discipline and determination to be successful as a college "student" and "athlete". 
										Through my experience as a Division One walk-on, I have learned to never just settle for something, 
										never turn down an opportunity to learn, and always find the time to get in extra work. 
										I plan on carrying this mentality as a Junior Software Engineer or Developer, where I can diligently build and develop new programs, 
										contribute to the success of my team, and grow personally and professionally.</p>
									<p>Between summer classes and fall camp during summer 2019, I rigorously studied machine learning with 
										Sebastian Raschka's <i>Python Machine Learning</i> in order to apply my economics degree and create a 
										bot to trade stocks while I was at practice. I ended up developing a passion for machine learning and programming as a whole. 
										This genuine interest made me want to push myself to take classes that I was advised against while playing football. 
										I chose these classes because they were heavily focused on math and more applicable to what I wanted to do, such as Calculus 2 
										(an elective I chose for my last semester), Financial Econometrics (emphasis on financial engineering), and Statistics. 
										Even while taking these high attrition rate classes, I felt that I could do more. 
										I completed Udemy courses for programing languages and I am still working on game development. 
										I also have watched hundreds of hours of programming projects on YouTube that were fun. 
										I am currently enrolled in formal computer science courses like Harvard's CS50 and applying the topics to my programs.</p>
									<p>Through football, the three awards I earned are the Iron Man Award (given to players who had never been late to or missed any academic or football activities), 
										Scout Player of the Week eight times, and Academic Honor Roll for three semesters. These awards demonstrate my work ethic, and ability to contribute to and lead a team.</p>
									<p>Thank you for allowing me to introduce myself. I look forward to the opportunity to further elaborate on how I would be a positive addition to your team.</p>
									<p>Best regards,</p>
									<p>Devin Lynch</p>
